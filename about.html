			<p>
				I'm just a regular dude that enjoys riding a snowboard over sand dunes, speaks fluent Japanese and once drove a jeep backwards down a mountain on a one-lane pathway during an off-roading challenge. But I wasn't always like this.
			</p>
			<p>
				Everything changed in 2014 when I decided to quit my job as a butler to become a foreign currency day trader. SPOILER ALERT: I never became wildly successful as an investor. But during that time I did rediscover my love of art and my passion to create things.
			</p>
			<p>
				It started with painting. And then moved to collage and large art pieces. I started painting live at shows, had an exhibit at a gallery here in Las Vegas and started selling my artwork too. It was great. Creating things that people could appreciate made me feel awesome. But why limit myself to the real world when I can create things in the virtual space too? And that's around the time I started learning front-end web development.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am a recent graduate of the Punchcode Front-End Developer bootcamp here in Las Vegas. It was a 12-week intensive course where we started with learning the fundamentals of web design (HTML5, CSS3, basic JavaScript), learned more challenging variations such as jQuery and AJAX, moved on to popular frameworks like React and Node and eventually learned to tie everything together in large scale projects. It was probably one of the hardest things I've done in my life. I learned a lot about coding and I learned a lot about myself.
			</p>
			<p>
				And now here I am, changing careers and bringing my management and teamwork experience to a new industry and hoping to make a name for myself. Its not going to be easy but anything worth fighting for always involves some struggle. That's how one grows.
			</p>
			<p>
				Still here? Go check out my resume. Or follow me on social media. I'm active on LinkedIn and I might become your next favorite blogger.
