This project originally began as a simple index.html landing page with contact information.

I have since updated it to include jQuery to handle animations and theme modes based on the time of day.
Night mode is for the evening hours and there is a special Miami mode too, using some pink and turquoise and the Neoneon font.

Styling was originally done with plain CSS and has been updated to use Bootstrap 4 with animations and transitions.

This page is simply my little corner of the dev world and a starting place to get to know me better.
